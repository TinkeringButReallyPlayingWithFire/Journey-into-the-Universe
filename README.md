Hello there,

"Journey into the Universe" is my final project submission for my Web Development module, as part of my BSc Computer Science degree.

There was an immense amount of thought and research that went into the pre planning, brainstorming and initilisation stages. Along the way, upon each iteration, as more of my initial plan came about, the urge to add more and more along the lines of the dreaded "feature creep" occured, which led to me abstracting until I was happy with a more _minimalistic__ take - the core theme in terms of color and layout came from entropys perpetual grip, causing disorder in the Universe. _


I sincerely thank you for your interest in me!
